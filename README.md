# AOG_GPS_ESP32
# Single and DUAL GPS supported!!
Bridge between GPS receiver and AgOpenGPS: transmit GPS Signal via WiFi or USB.

Works with 1 or 2 UBlox receivers to calculate heading+roll. Corrects position by using roll and filters, depends on GPS signal quality.
uses nebkat NTRIP on ESP32 to UBlox

for ESP32

you can use WiFi connection

you can change the settings via webinterface: x.x.x.79
when access to your network fails, an accesspoint is created. Webinterface address: 192.168.1.1

for easier setup use webinterface, turn debugmessageUBX on and change PIN allignment until you get data from the receivers


# This a work in progress from https://github.com/mtz8302/AOG_GPS_ESP32 to work with the dual GPS PCB in AOG-Addendum
# While the following instructions are relevant, it will work better to just use the included config file

Config via UCenter:
First set on both boards UART1 speed to 115200, UART2 speed to 460800 and activate NMEA+UBX+RTCM3 to inputs and UBX +RTCM3 to output on UART1+2. Then set Nav Rate to 100ms (10Hz).
In the messages I deactivated everything expect of (UBX) NavPVT and (NMEA) GSV on UART1 at one board and NavRelPosNED on UART1 at the other board. At the right (position) F9P activate the RTCM messages 1077/1087/1097/1127/1230/4072.0/4072.1 on UART2.

Donâ€™t forget to save the config!

Wiring the receiver boards:
Connect Tx2 and Rx2 from one board to the other to get RTCM over (1x).
Connect RX1 and TX1 from both boards to ESP32 GPIOs (not #6-12) (IOref to 3.3V!!!)
The ESP32 is connected to both boards UART1 separately (2x2 pins, RX/TX crossed (setup zone in code)). From one board you get UBX NavPVT and from the other UBX NavRelPosNED.
